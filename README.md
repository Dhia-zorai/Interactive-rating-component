### Built with

### What I learned

```css
Through this project, I have learned:
- How to approach design with a mobile-first mindset.
- How to use `rem` and the `clamp()` function to maximize responsiveness.
- How to use Flexbox for layout and alignment across different screen sizes.
- How to use modern CSS selectors for consistent vertical spacing between elements.
```

```js
// JavaScript
- How to select and manipulate DOM elements to create interactive UI components.
- How to use event listeners to toggle classes and update the UI dynamically.
- How to manage component state (like showing/hiding the share menu) with class toggling.

```

```
// Accessibility
Hereâ€™s what I learned about accessibility from this project:

- Use aria-labels and roles to make interactive elements understandable for screen readers.
- Provide descriptive alt text for all images.
- Add a skip link for keyboard users to jump to main content.
- Use visible focus styles so keyboard users can see which element is focused.
- Use aria-live regions to announce dynamic content changes.
- Ensure color contrast is sufficient for readability.

```
